# Changelog

All notable changes to the GitHub Desktop for VS Code extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v1.8.1] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed
- Marketplace publish step failing on a false-positive secret scan (a
  placeholder PAT string in the "enter your token" input box)

## [v1.8.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Merge a branch into the current branch from the branch dropdown, with a
  confirmation guard against merging the default branch in the wrong
  direction

### Fixed
- CI/release workflows updated to the npm + webpack build introduced in
  v1.7.0 (previously still targeting the removed pnpm/vite/webview build)

## [v1.7.0] - 2026-09-17

### Changed
- SOLID rewrite of the extension backend: the message-handler god object
  split into cohesive services (working-tree, sync, branch, commit-actions,
  conflict, stash, diff, pull-request, repository-data) behind ports &
  adapters, with a single composition root (`TimelineController`)
- Webview replaced: React/MUI/vite timeline and commit-detail panel
  rewritten as one self-contained HTML/CSS/JS view modeled on the GitHub
  Desktop app; bundle size reduced from ~600 KB to ~300 KB
- New diff renderer styled like VS Code's native diff editor, with dual
  gutters and word-level intra-line highlighting
- Git auth now uses an ephemeral `-c http.extraheader` instead of writing
  the token into `.git/config`

### Added
- Force-push (`--force-with-lease`), branch comparison, undo last commit,
  amend, co-authors, conflict resolution (continue/abort/mark resolved),
  and stash (push/apply/drop)
- Branch dropdown ordered by recency (MRU via reflog)
- Repository picker that also opens the folder in VS Code
- Pull request list, with checkout via the GitHub REST API

### Removed
- History Explorer and the old React timeline
